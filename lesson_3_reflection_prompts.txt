When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    to share with others for the changes I've made and let them can pull

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because sometimes these changes come from pull might cause conflicts

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    depend on situations
    Fork: base on other projects and create my own features
    clones : multi-contributor working on same project
    branch : if these changes i will update to master later

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    to tracing the change made after last pull or clone?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    easier : faster change applying
    harder : when the projects became bigger, hard to manage changes

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    if there are different approachs and work by different group of people
    use branch and we can check out the result before deciding
