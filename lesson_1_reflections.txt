How viewing diff is good for knowing bugs/
1. to compare files line by line is more easy to read
2. easy to find typo

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
1. knowing the change history makes better understanding for program
2. to recall things happens before(not chasing my own tail)
3.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros:
    better version control of demand features.
cons:
    if some accident happened or just forgot to save, that will be bad.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
because we can't ignore these correlations between files in a program project, unlike Docs, needs to be traced together

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
because I can switch between commit to check functions, without losing changes in the process.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
setting up my own github space
